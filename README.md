## 📖 About the Project

This portfolio was built as a showcase of **technical skill**, **aesthetic taste**, and **design sensibility**. It’s intended to serve as a professional identity online and to demonstrate mastery of:

- Modern front-end workflows
- Responsive design principles
- Motion design using JavaScript
- Utility-first CSS architecture with Tailwind CSS

It's a no-template, no-bootstrap zone—every pixel and animation is handcrafted.
